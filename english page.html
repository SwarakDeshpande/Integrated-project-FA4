<p>Ila sachani, a daughter of a poor farmer,was born in 1972 in the amreli district of gujrat.Ila was born with a deformity that led to her hands becoming useless. As a young child, ila was very fond of learnng many different styles of embroidery. however, the style that was she was extremely fond of was kathiawar. she wanted to learn those not only from her own state that is gujrat, but from other places too like kachhi, kashmiri and lucknawi embroidery. Each one of these styles were special to her so she decided to learn all! everyone around her supported her but in particular ,her mother and her grandmother were the most encouraging.they encouraged her to pursue her dreams.they also taught her to create many beautiful patterns using her feet.not a part of it was easy ,but ila kept pushing herself out of her comfort zone and finally acheived "the impossible" .</p>
