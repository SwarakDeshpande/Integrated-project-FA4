<h2 class="city">COMMUNICATION SATELLITES:GSAT</h2>
<p>the GSAT series of satellites, developed by Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), provides communication services, including television broadcasting, telecomunnication, and internet services.these satellites have played a crucial role in connecting rural india, faciliatating e-governance,and enabling disastermanagement.</p>
 
<h2 clas="city">REGIONAL GPS SYSTEM</h2>
<p>NAVIC, or Navigation with Indian Constellation, is India's regional satellite navigation system. It provides accurate positioning and timing services, similar to the U.S based GPS. NAVIC has numerous applications including:</p>

<p>1.Navigation - helping drivers, pilots,and sailors navigate through indian waters</p>
<p>2.Disaster management - enabling emergency responders to quickly locate affected areas and provide aid.</p>
<p>3.Weather Forecasting - Assisting meteorologists in predicting weather patterns and issuing timely warnings.</p>


<h2 class="city">WEATHER PREDICTION AND DIASTER MANAGEMENT</h2>
<p>India's satellites hae significantly improved weather forecasting and disaster management. satellites like INSAT and Kalpana-1 provide critical data on weather patterns, enabling meteorologists to predict cyclones, floods, and other severe weather events. This information helps authorities evcuate people, provide aid, and minimize damage.</p>

<h2 class ="city">OTHER NOTIBLE CONTRIBUTIONS</h2>
<p>India has also made notible contributions to satellite technology through other projects like:</p>
<p>1. Chandrayan-1 :India's first lunar mission, which successfully orbited the moon and provided valuble data on its geology and composition.</p>
<p>2.Mars Obiter Mission (MOM): India's first interplanetery mission, which successfully orbited Mars and provided valuable data on its atmosphere and geology.</p>
<br>

<p>In conclusion, India's contributions to satellite technology have been significant, and projects like GSAT and NAVIC have revolutionized communication, navigation, and disaster managemement in the country.</P>
